Contains C++ Opencv implementation of Visual S\+L\+AM (IN P\+R\+O\+G\+R\+E\+SS)

Please note that this is a IN P\+R\+O\+G\+R\+E\+SS work.

Currently only Visual odometry is implemented\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I used O\+RB to extract keypoints.
\item Keypoint matching between consecutives frames.
\item I used projective geometry constraints to refine matches (Fundamental matrix and homography).
\item Once matches are relatively OK I can use camera calibration parameters to find Essential matrix, camera pose and triangulate the keypoints to estimate their 3D position up to scale. During this process a final oulier rejection is performed to keep only few but sure points as landmarks.
\end{DoxyItemize}

T\+O\+DO\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Local optimization with g2o or other optimization framework.
\item Define a good data structure and representation for mapping (for embedded platforms)
\item Global optimization
\item Use all this for path planning
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{These are preliminary results of odometry using Kitty dataset running on N\+Vidia Jetson T\+X2 board\+:}
